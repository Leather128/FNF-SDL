# FNF-SDL
FNF Made in C++ with SDL2 cuz I got bored or something idfk lool

# Building the game

Uh rn I only tested this stuff on Linux (Endeavour OS specifically), but uh just so you know, you need SDL2, SDL_image, SDL_ttf, and SDL_mixer_ext (and prolly SDL_mixer too)

SDL_mixer_ext is found at: [This GitHub Repository](https://github.com/WohlSoft/SDL-Mixer-X) (we use it for a more simple audio library BUT multiple audio streams).
